Beschreibung für linkmap:

A Linkage Map is a 2D scatter plot that displays the result of Sammon's nonlinear mapping. You define a number of ranges (>= 1) for the distance values d[i,j]. Each point pair whose distance is inside of the defined range is connected with a line. You can change the ranges dynamically at runtime with sliders.

The ranges are defined by thresholds t[k](1<=k<=n) in the following way 
range[1]: d[i,j] <= t[1]	
range[i]: t[k-1] < d[i,j] <= t[k]




Beschreibung für fuzzyColorPlot:

A fuzzy color plot is a 2D scatterplot that displays the result of sammons nonlinear mapping. Additionally a fuzzy clustering is made.

If the slider is on the first position, all cluster are displayed together. The color/symbol indicates the nearest crisp clustering then. The color intensity displays the probability of membership to the nearest cluster.

You can select a single cluster too. The color intensity shows the probability of membership to the selected cluster.




Kurzbeschreibung für das packet als ganzes:

The Linkage Maps package provides functions to display multivariate data, based on sammons nonlinear mapping.
